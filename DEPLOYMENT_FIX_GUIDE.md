# 🚀 Complete Deployment Fix Guide

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. ✅ Content Security Policy (CSP) - Fixed
**Problem:** `Refused to load the script 'https://sdk.cashfree.com/js/v4/cashfree.js' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive`

**Solution:** Added Cashfree SDK domain to server CSP configuration
- Updated `/Server/index.js` to include `"https://sdk.cashfree.com"` in scriptSrc directive
- Server restart required to apply changes

### 2. ✅ Environment Variables - Fixed  
**Problem:** `authentication Failed` error after deployment

**Solution:** Updated environment configuration
- Fixed field names from `CASHFREE_CLIENT_ID` → `CASHFREE_APP_ID`
- Fixed field names from `CASHFREE_CLIENT_SECRET` → `CASHFREE_SECRET_KEY` 
- Set production credentials in database
- Updated admin panel form fields

### 3. ✅ Database Configuration - Fixed
**Problem:** Environment variables not persisting in deployed environment

**Solution:** Stored credentials in MongoDB database
- Credentials: `104850289018eb5138eb795eac92058401` / `cfsk_ma_prod_df3b7f6d9e170f5d5f5b4ac233f4708b_7e8fcd48`
- Environment: `PRODUCTION`
- COD enabled as backup payment method

## 🔧 Deployment Commands:

### Build the application:
```bash
npm run build
```

### Start the production server:
```bash
npm start
```

## 🎯 Verification Steps:

### 1. Check CSP Fix:
- Restart server after deployment
- Open browser console
- Should no longer see CSP errors for Cashfree SDK

### 2. Check Environment Configuration:
- Go to `/myadmin/env` 
- Navigate to Payment section
- Verify Cashfree App ID and Secret Key are populated
- Ensure Environment is set to "Production"

### 3. Test Payment Flow:
- Add items to cart
- Proceed to checkout
- Click "Pay Now" 
- Should redirect to Cashfree payment page without authentication errors

## 🔐 Admin Panel Access:

### Admin Login URL:
```
{your-domain}/myadmin/login
```

### Environment Configuration:
```  
{your-domain}/myadmin/env
```

### Payment Settings Location:
- Login to admin panel
- Go to "Environment Settings"
- Navigate to "Payment Methods" tab
- Verify Cashfree credentials are loaded

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions:

### If payment still shows "authentication Failed":
1. Check server logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify environment variables in admin panel
3. Ensure CASHFREE_ENVIRONMENT is set to "production"
4. Check that credentials match exactly (no extra spaces)

### If CSP errors persist:
1. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+F5)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Verify server restart completed
4. Check browser console for updated CSP headers

### If admin panel doesn't load credentials:
1. Run the credential setup script again:
   ```bash
   cd Server && node set-cashfree-credentials.js
   ```
2. Refresh admin panel page
3. Check MongoDB connection in server logs

## 📱 Mobile Testing:
- Payment redirects work on mobile devices
- Cashfree SDK loads properly on mobile browsers
- Success/failure redirects function correctly

## 🔄 Environment Sync:
- Database configuration overrides .env files
- Changes in admin panel are persisted in MongoDB
- No need to redeploy for configuration changes

## 🎉 Success Indicators:
- ✅ No CSP errors in browser console
- ✅ Payment page loads Cashfree interface
- ✅ Successful order creation (ORDER_xxxxxx format)
- ✅ Proper redirects to /thankyou or /cart
- ✅ Admin panel shows populated credentials

Your payment system is now fully configured for production deployment! 🚀
